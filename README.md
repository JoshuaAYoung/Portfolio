## Live App: [Portfolio](https://joshyoung.net)

This fully responsive portfolio website was built during my time in Thinkful's full-stack bootcamp. The design and CSS are all from scratch - no templates, no bootstrap. To push myself and my learning, I decided to store everything in a JSON-esque array that facilitates the addition of new projects. After all, if we're not moving towards iteration, then what are we doing? 

The data array functionality is demo'd at the bottom of the app using a small, jQuery-powered form. 

Taking it a step further, a blank form submission will make a fetch request to an api and generate a random image to serve as the project screenshot. 

At this point, you might be thinking to yourself that this is probably overkill for a simple portfolio website... And to that I say: You are absolutely correct. But why waste an opportunity to showcase some of the experience I've picked up? Why not provide another example of my transferable design skills? Isn't the true purpose of a portfolio to showcase one's talents? And if I can learn a thing or two along the way by adding on... seems like a win / win (/win?).

Plus. Look at those cats. How can you be upset at that those faces? Are you a monster...?
