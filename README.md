# Josh Young - Portfolio

This portfolio was built during my time in Thinkful's full-stack bootcamp. To push myself and my learning, I decided to store everything in a JSON-esque array that facilitates the addition of new projects. After all, if we're not moving towards iteration, then what are we doing? 

The data array functionality is demo'd at the bottom of the app using a simple, jQuery powered form. 

Taking it a step further, a blank form submission will make a fetch request to an api and generate a random cat image to serve as the project screenshot. 

At this point, you might be thinking to yourself that this is way overkill for a simple portfolio website... And to that I say: You are absolutely correct! I could have provided raw text and passed along the same information. But why waste an opportunity to showcase some of the experience I've picked up? Why not provide another example the transferability of my design skills? Isn't the true purpose of a portfolio to showcase one's talents? And if I can learn a thing or two along the way by doing another rep... Seems like a win - win (win?).

Plus. Look at those cats. How can you be upset at that...? Are you a monster?
