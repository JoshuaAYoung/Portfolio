# Josh Young - Portfolio

## Notables
- The design and CSS of this fully responsive (if basic) jQuery portfolio are all from scratch - no templates, no bootstrap. 
- The geometric background you see outside of the hero is a seamless .SVG texture I painstakingly crafted in Illustrator before importing (as a repeating vector) to the single page portfolio background.
- The site is fairly static. There was a to-do list with animations, more features, etc but life.
  - Scratch CSS is fun but man what a time hole.
